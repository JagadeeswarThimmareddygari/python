## Exception handling
There are two types of erros that typically occur while writing programs. The first one is known as syntax error,simply means that the programmer has made mistake in the structure of the statement or expression
For example, it is incorrect to write a for statement and forget the colon.
```python
>>> for i in range(10)
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (<pyshell#61>, line 1)
```
